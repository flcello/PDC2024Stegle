# Intro

We will see how [muon](https://github.com/scverse/muon) can be useful for handling multimodal datasets.

# Data

Firstly, we will go through a short overview of single-cell multi-omics, which allows to profile different aspects of cell biology.

Secondly, we will see how we can obtain and load public datasets, and how we can benefit from the [`mudatasets`](https://github.com/PMBio/mudatasets) library.

Then we'll experience how `muon` workflow allows to conveniently analyse individual modalities as well as prepare for and perform multimodal integration.

# MuData

We will use a standard for multimodal datasets â€” MuData. You can refer to [the documentation](https://mudata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart_mudata.html) for more details but we will cover its key features in this part of the course.

# Notebooks

For this part of the course, we prepared the following notebooks:

- MuData introduction notebook.

## Multimodal omics processing and integration tutorials

There are more publicly available `muon` tutorials, for instance:

- [Multiome (RNA+ATAC)](https://muon-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/single-cell-rna-atac/index.html)
- [CITE-seq (RNA+PROT)](https://muon-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cite-seq/index.html)

## Multiome data

Here are some other multiome datasets that one can try `muon` on:

- [3k healthy brain cells](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/frozen-human-healthy-brain-tissue-3-k-1-standard-2-0-0) from 10X Genomics
- Other brain datasets, e.g. [Trevino2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867421009429)

## CITE-seq data

Here are some othe CITE-seq datasets that one can try `muon` on:

- Other CITE-seq datasets, e.g. [Triana2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01059-0)
